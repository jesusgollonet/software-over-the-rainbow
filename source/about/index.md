A blog on programming, music, new media, art, actionscript, processing, chuck and everything else.

I have been writing this blog since 2004, with topics as fluctuant as my own interests. Lately it&#8217;s mostly thoughts about software, but there are some experiments and hacks, and some hopefully useful things.

Some of it is english and some in spanish.
