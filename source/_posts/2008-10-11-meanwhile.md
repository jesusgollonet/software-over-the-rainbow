An [openFrameworks][1] workgroup has started this week at [Hangar.][2] Every thursday until March, the wise Arturo will be there helping you with any doubt that you have. From 19 to 21 pm. [+info][3]

The equally talented [Chris Sugrue][4] will be doing the same in Madrid&#8217;s [Medialab][5]. Every friday from 19 to 21pm. [+info][6]

Last, and this has been going on for some months now, the incombustible [Alba Corral][7] has created an increasingly active [spanish speaking processing community][8], with forum, wiki and more cool projects on the way. 

Edit: I almost forget that there is also an [introductory workshop to computer sound synthesis ][9] taught (with [chuck][10]) by Eduard Aylon. In a couple of weeks also in hangar.
