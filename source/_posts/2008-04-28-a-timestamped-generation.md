Thinking about the traces we leave behind in all the software we use, I was wondering: 

How will the biography of a data-intensive person &#8211; you know, blogs, twitter, delicious, tumblr, last.fm&#8230;- look like in the future? Will those &#8220;[*domestic privacies*][1]&#8221; be taken into account?

How will the fact that we have a clear, unambiguous point of reference for our own thoughts, places visited, people met, images, consumed products&#8230; affect the way we perceive ourselves? or the way we will be perceived in the future? 

Just thinking out loud, to hear how it sounds like.
