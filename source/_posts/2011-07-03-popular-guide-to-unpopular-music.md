I keep going back to the [popular guide to unpopular music][1], a series of articles on avant-garde music and life written by [kenneth goldsmith][2] around the end of last century. On [&#8220;don&#8217;t quit your day job. yet&#8230;&#8221;]() he interviews 5 composers about how their (non-composing related) day job has helped and influenced their practice. [&#8220;High pop: the avant garde as ear candy&#8221;][3] is a grumpy reflection on the popularisation of new music in the late nineties, with the american premiere of a xenakis piece as an excuse. The generally disgruntled style and his deep knowledge of the subject make the articles a very engaging read.
