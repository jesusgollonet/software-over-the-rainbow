I keep going back to this beautiful story in my head. 

After having had a show cancelled, steve roden drove back home and performed there alone, when the sun was rising. He recorded himself and made the piece available along with the story and a couple of blurry cell phone pictures of the moments in which he started and finished. The piece is a calm and intimate improvisation, with imperfections that denote the just-because-ness of the event:

[when sun rises in spite of hooligans][1]

The three elements (writing, music, pictures) make the story so lively that I&#8217;ve almost came to regard it as my own memory.
