Being an actionscript head, I&#8217;ve frequently used [rober penner&#8217;s easing equations][1] in processing*. To avoid copy/paste each time I&#8217;ve packed them as a processing library. 

While I was at it, I discovered a couple of implementations ([1][2], [2][3]), but I was almost done, and wanted to learn how to make processing libraries anyway.

So in the hope that it is useful to somebody, here it is:

**I&#8217;m also using them in openFrameworks, so I&#8217;ve begun porting them to c++ too. They&#8217;ll be here when I&#8217;m done.*
