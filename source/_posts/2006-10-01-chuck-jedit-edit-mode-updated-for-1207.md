[ChucK][1] has gone through some [api changes and tasty additions][2] (low, band, high and stop pass filters&#8230;) in its last revision. I&#8217;ve just updated the edit mode which I did for [JEdit][3]. You can get it from here:

[Chuck jedit mode updated for 1.2.0.7][4]

For instructions on how to install, have a look at the previous post: [JEdit for ChucK][5]

**Update:**** ** [Thomas Friese][6] has sent me a corrected version (mainly with removed duplicates) and has added some missing properties and methods. Now it is the &#8220;official&#8221; download. Thanks Tasmo!
