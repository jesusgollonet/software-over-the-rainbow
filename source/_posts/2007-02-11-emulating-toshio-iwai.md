This is an attempt at [emulating][1] a simple but beautiful piece that [toshio iwai][2] showed at the last [ars electronica][3]. Basically a video is divided into different portions and each of them is delayed by a certain amount of frames. 

Thanks to [the magic of ][4][openframeworks][5], it is realtime video.
