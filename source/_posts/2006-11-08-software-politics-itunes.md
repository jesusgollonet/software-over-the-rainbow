I don&#8217;t mind listening to Steve Reich after Stereolab. Ornette Coleman is not bad after Odd Nosdam. Beans and Beastie Boys are a good couple too&#8230; but I can&#8217;t stand Daft punk after Daedelus, nor Dizzee Rascal after Dinosaur Jr; and I just hate listening to Cat Power everytime I finish listening to Caribou.

Definitely, I don&#8217;t like listening to music alphabetically ordered as Itunes wants me to.
