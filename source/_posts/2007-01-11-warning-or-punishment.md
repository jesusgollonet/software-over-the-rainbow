For the underground, I always buy a 10 journey ticket. I never have a look at how many of them I spend. It always gives me a (**punishment**) beep when the ticket is over, and I have to go back to buy a new one. How about giving me a (**warning**) beep when I use the last trip so I can buy the new one in advance?
