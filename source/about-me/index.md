Jesús Gollonet is a creative coder with an interest in the poetic combination of everyday objects with computers. He develops interactive entertainment for devices, spaces and the web for a living, and crafts electronic music, cutout poetry and nonsense software the rest of the time. He has studied Psychology, Multimedia and a postgraduate course in Sonology. His preferred tools are openframeworks, supercollider, simple electronics, scissors and glue. 

Some interesting projects I&#8217;ve worked on (needs updating):

*   [Animo][1], an installation for building stop-motion animations combining drawings and people pictures in real-time, which will be shown at [the public gallery][2] in Birmingham
*   [Animo &#8220;box&#8221;][3], an application + hardware module that makes extremely intuitive and quick the process of making stop-motion animation. Built for a couple of animation workshops for children 8-10 years old and people with learning difficulties as part of the Animo project 
*   [Mesosfera][4], a multitouch table for schools
*   [Piuapp][5], an application that exports pdfs with a custom modular font where the user can input the text and use his own module design.
*   Some advertising pieces including these 2 [interactive][6] [video][7] pieces for spontex, a small [showroom][8] for barcelóviajes and this [racket breaking game][9] for seat

Some online traces: The [bookmarks][10] I find worthwile , a [log][11] of the net things I consume, what I read [daily][12], the (mostly project-related) [pics][13] and [videos][14] I publish, and the [music][15] I devote my ears to.
