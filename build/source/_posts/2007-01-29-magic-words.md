There are some words I&#8217;ve put under suspicion. They&#8217;re like magic. When they appear everything seems better, more pleasant, more adequate&#8230;

I still don&#8217;t know what it is, but I&#8217;m somehow annoyed. Perphaps they appear too frequently in advertising, products, speeches&#8230; I think they hide some&#8230; swindle. 

3 come to mind now:

*   New
*   Easy
*   Original

do you have more? do you know what it is?
