I'm Jesus Gollonet, a software developer with 10 years of experience. I'm based in Amsterdam but I can travel and work remotely. Since April 2014 I'm available for contract work as a freelancer.

My main focus is currently full stack web development, closer to the front end and with an eye on application architecture, operations, backend integration and process management.

Before going freelance, I was as senior developer/tech lead at [Resn](http://resn.co.nz) Amsterdam. I was in charge of defining and developing project architecture, backend coordination and implementation, deployment, front end operations, server setup, team management and of course, frontend development. Before that I worked at [Wieden+Kennedy Amsterdam](http://www.wkamst.com/), mostly as part of [The Dam Armada](http://thedamarmada.com/), where we developed prototypes and interactive products. I worked on mobile (iOS and Android) and desktop apps. With the W+K design team I created an app to generate the global coca cola music visual identity system. 

Some of my favorite projects to have worked on are [adidas originals tumblr](http://adidasoriginals.tumblr.com/),  [rei 1440 project](http://rei1440project.com/), [coca cola music vis](http://www.wkamst.com/#!/work/detail/coca-cola-music-vis), [i am not an artist, gif paranoia](http://soonintokyo.com/im-not-an-artist-an-animated-gif-paranoia), [i am not an artist, webcomic](http://soonintokyo.com/im-not-an-artist-webcomic).

I have taught a university level yearlong course on digital design and development at [ESDI](http://esdi.es/en/) (Sabadell, Barcelona) and co-taught a workshop on mobile development using openframeworks at [IMAL](http://imal.org/) (Brussels). 

You can check the rest of my work experience in [my resume](http://resume.jesusgollonet.com/).

Some of my favorite tools are javascript, git, unix, openframeworks, ruby, supercollider, http, electronics, node.js, paper, zsh, microphones, backbone.js and math. I'm always exploring automation and process optimization. I'm excited about functional programming, agility (TDD, BDD) and audio development. I'm an ok writer. I'd quit all of that to make music fulltime.

I'm interested in developing and growing software projects, helping teams do the same, and teaching.
