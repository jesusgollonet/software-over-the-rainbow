In programming, when you’re struggling to express a concept clearly and find yourself patching code with hacks, often times it means you’re operating at the wrong level of abstraction. and jumping up or down will make ideas flow naturally.

I just had the same experience while writing, where taking a step back and explaining things from a more general perspective made what I wanted to express self-evident.

Now, similes can get silly pretty quickly if taken too far, but I’m finding some interesting tips in pushing this one a bit. Thinking of paragraphs as functions, local variables in a text, modular writing, short texts that explain just one thing and explain it well...
