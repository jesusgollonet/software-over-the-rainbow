[Instruction set][1] is a recently launched site that gives some instructions every month and asks for implementations in code. Think Sol Lewitt goes 2.0 (sorry I couldn&#8217;t resist). It is a beautiful simple idea and It&#8217;s stealing me lots of braincycles ([see][2]).

I&#8217;ve heard raindrops here and there about design by limitation lately. Number of chars in twitter, flickr video length, 1 photo/day in fotolog&#8230; There are a couple of limitations in instructionset which I missed at first but on a second thought I found interesting:

*   **There&#8217;s no clear way to post a result** (images, applets, audio&#8230;). 
You can always give a url, but it is not even suggested. I thought it might be an obvious improvement, but after trying to come up with solutions for the 2 first instructions, I&#8217;ve discovered that results could be a distraction. Instructions are about language and interpretation. I&#8217;ve found myself repeating the sentence, trying to define exactly every word, looking for a fold, or a flaw in which to introduce a deviation&#8230; Thinking how they relate to the programming language, how I relate to the programming language (specially with the first one &#8220;draw a straight line and follow it&#8221;)&#8230; I think that this relationship between everyday and programming language is a powerful one to explore.

*   **There is no form of comments/discussion** other than the description of you implementation.
After seeing some of the contributions, I&#8217;ve found interesting approaches and I&#8217;d like to give feedback, but given the overwhelming noise ratio in today&#8217;s software playgrounds, I appreciate that there&#8217;s no way to do it. Paraphrasing Cage: just respond with your implementation. </ul> 
Now, I don&#8217;t know if these are intended features or result of an early release, but if one could vote against new features&#8230; :)
