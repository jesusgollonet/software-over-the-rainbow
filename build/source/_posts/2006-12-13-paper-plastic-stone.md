I&#8217;ve been thinking about differences that different technologies (as such, regardless of what we do with them) offer in user experience. They&#8217;re like different materials: 

*   **DHTML = Paper**: Transparent, accesible, malleable, fragile
*   **Flash = Plastic**: Vectorial, fluid, &#8220;stretchable&#8221;, shiny&#8230;
*   **Java = Stone**: Heavy, unchangeable (no right click), exclusive&#8230;

Usually, the choice of the technology to use for a project is based in parameters which are previous to the design of the experience (availability, developer skills, &#8220;client wanted this&#8221;&#8230;)

I wonder if we could take into account those intrinsic charasteristics when we think of the end user. In print design you would choose different materials depending on the effect that you want to cause&#8230;
