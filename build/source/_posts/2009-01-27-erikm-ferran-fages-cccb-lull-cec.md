This was going to be a blog post about how sometimes I discover a new music scene that I have no clue about and get into hunter mode, looking for more about the context, label, whatever in a glutton, semi-intoxicated state, and how this week this has happened with emeralds, and the not-new-york-not-california usa experimental music scene, which release mostly on tape and cdr, and how a couple of months ago it was experimental turntablism, via dj sniff, steim, erikm, paul bell, james kelly and the itchy muzik forum which extended my rather traditional philip jeck/christian marclay culture in that area.

But it ended being a linkless, 5 minute post because it was getting long, and was going to get lost as always, and the only thing that I really wanted was an excuse to plug a concert by [erikm &#038; ferran fages next week (wednesday 4th, 21:00) at cccb (bcn)][1]. organised by [l&#8217;ull cec][2], a collective that is arranging lots of concerts that I usually haven&#8217;t attended because I didn&#8217;t know the artists, but end up invariably regreting 2 or 3 months later when I discover them.

Not this time.
