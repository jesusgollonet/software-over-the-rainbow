[Friendship in C++][1]: A friend of a class is an external function or class that has access to the private and protected members of this class. Isn&#8217;t it lovely?

**More favorites:**

*   In [chuck][2], [function declaration is fun][3].
*   [maybe()][4] (also from chuck): a method for the non-decisive programmer. Returns 0 or 1 at random.
