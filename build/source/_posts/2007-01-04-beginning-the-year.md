![a bloglines screenshot with 0 feeds][1]

As [my rss reader doesn&#8217;t still forget feeds for me][2], I&#8217;ve had to force a total amnesia.[ I&#8217;ve done it before][3], but now I&#8217;m not going to get my opml back. I&#8217;ll add just the ones I remember&#8230; 

Happy new formatted year!

**Update:**Might be time to switch rss reader too, as now google reader *&#8220;provides a trends page filled with graphs and widgets that keeps you up-to-date on your own usage.&#8221;* (via [o&#8217;reily radar][4]). 

Ah, those [traces of interaction][5]&#8230;
