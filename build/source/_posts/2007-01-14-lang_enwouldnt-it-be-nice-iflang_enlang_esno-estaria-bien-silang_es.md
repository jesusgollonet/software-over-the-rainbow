&#8230;you could take some notes about the songs you are listening directly on the [last.fm player][1]? 

Nothing too fancy. Something similar to the [delicious][2] notes would be ok. 

By now I&#8217;m using a tag ([toresearch][3]) for discovered artists, and sometimes I take notes on my [helipad][4], but adding them right on the player would save some work, and definitely add richer information than just tags to help you keep track of good discovered artists, special songs&#8230; They shouldn&#8217;t be necessarily public (although they could). 

This could make a good project for hacking the [available source code for the last.fm player][5] (mental note: learn [subversion][6])

Yes, [more last.fm][7]. I can&#8217;t get it out of my head.
