Still happily living on [jEdit][1] for most of my scripting. I haven&#8217;t found an actionscript 3 edit mode, so I&#8217;ve made one. It is based on the original actionscript.xml and the Flash CS3 AsColorSyntax_3.xml file so it should have everything you can see colored on the IDE. 

This edit mode doesn&#8217;t have any as2 specific keywords, so if you have to work on as2 don&#8217;t delete the original. Otherwise, you can just replace your original actionscript.xml file (you&#8217;ll find it problably in &#8220;c:\program files\jEdit\modes&#8221; if you&#8217;re on win xp) with this one. Make a backup of the original, just in case.

Grab the [actionscript 3 edit mode for jEdit][2]
