I don&#8217;t remember how I arrived at [sonenvir][1], a

> research project that investigates applying sonification in a number of scientific disciplines, in order to develop a general sonification software environment.

but after seeing [Psycollider][2] , I&#8217;m really glad I did.

Psycollider is a windows port of the popular [Supercollider][3] *real time audio synthesis programming language.* As far as I know, it used to be only for the mac. Then there was a Linux version and someone was working on a Windows one, but this port seemed too outdated and inactive for me to bother trying it.

Yesterday, when I found it with a nice installer and simple instructions, I couldn&#8217;t resist installing it, and after figuring out a couple of oddities, I&#8217;ve been able to make some noise&#8230;

More on this to come soon, I guess.
