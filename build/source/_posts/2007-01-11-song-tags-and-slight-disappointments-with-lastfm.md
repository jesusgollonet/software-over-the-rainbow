I&#8217;m always amazed at the use of tags in last.fm, specially for songs. 

Some random examples I&#8217;ve seen lately:

*   [Stereolab &#8211; Hallucinex][1]: resistance is futile, electronic renaissance, sounds like sun, sigh and swoon in equal measure.
*   [Stereolab &#8211; Nothing to do with me][2]: music to edit pictures to.
*   [Stereolab &#8211; Suggestion diabolique][3]: take the bull by the horns
*   [Daedelus &#8211; Thus the whirligig][4]: achingly intelligent
*   [u-ziq &#8211; mushroom compost][5]: I am a party girl here is my soundtrack, systolische phase

What I love is the interpretations they suggest. And most of the times you can understand what the tag means listening to the song.

And then two things I don&#8217;t like about the last (otherwise great) [last.fm player][6] update (1.1.0.0):

1.  As far as I know, I can no longer see this information (tags for the currently playing song) directly in the player. That was, as you&#8217;ve seen, a good source of joy
2.  You can no longer construct a multiple artist radio either in the web or the radio player. I cannot see a reason for this, as [you can still do it with a url][7] (Note: this link will try to open your last.fm player, if you have one, and will tune in a radio based on all the artists mentioned in this post). Hope they are not deprecating this feature, as I have something soon to release based on that
