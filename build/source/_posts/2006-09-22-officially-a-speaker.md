So yesterday I gave a talk about my experience with processing at the [*begining processing* workshop][1] which is being held at [Hangar][2] by [Joan Soler][3].

First part was about my reasons for learning-using-loving processing and how I&#8217;ve managed to use it in a commercial context. Then I went into a tutorial explaining the [ascii video sketch][4]. Finally i improvised an explanation of a del.icio.us information visualization project I had done at a [previous workshop][5], which i think turned to be the most interesting thing for the audience.

It was my first experience as a speaker and although i don&#8217;t think it went too bad, the ascii tutorial didn&#8217;t work as I expected. Going too deep into code details doesn&#8217;t seem to be approppriate for a one hour session. Lesson learned.

Anyway, here are the [slides][6] (in spanish only) and the [source files][7] for the ascii tutorial.

Thanks very much to Joan for inviting me and to all the assistants for not leaving the room.
