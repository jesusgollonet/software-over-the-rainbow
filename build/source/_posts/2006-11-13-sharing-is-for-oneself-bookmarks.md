Some days ago, I added a list with [my last bookmarks][1] in [delicious][2] to the sidebar. As soon as it began to work, I realised something: as in most cases I didn&#8217;t change the bookmark&#8217;s title and I usually left the extended description empty (trusting heavily in tags as a retreival tool), most of the links said very little about its content.

The thing I love most of delicious is its cognitive economy, and I use delicious for myself. I thought that adding that extra information would be cumbersome, so I thought of removing the thing on the sidebar. 

But instead I began editing titles and adding some extended descriptions. Now it takes me something like 10 to 30 seconds more to add a link, but instead of losing, I think I&#8217;ve taken advantage of it:

*   better self-filtering when adding (when I&#8217;m thinking of a description i can decide if I&#8217;ll really need it or will be of interest later).
*   improved retrieving (either me and the delicious search engine have more information when having a look or searching through my bookmarks)
*   overall consciousness of what I&#8217;m adding (It had become such an automatic thing that rarely I remembered what I had after a couple of days). This last consequence is the best, as it keeps in my head a nice limbo of things to review

So as it happens with blogs, if you do things for yourself, but publicly, you do them better.
