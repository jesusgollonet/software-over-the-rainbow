*&#8220;I just hate information visualization. Those guys want to put lines everywhere&#8221;*

*&#8220;That thing that you listen to sounds like a radio **out of tune**&#8220;*

* &#8220;Blogs? Aren&#8217;t they those web pages where teens tell their secrets?&#8221;*

Oversimplification is lovingly enlightening when applied to something that you usually spend a lot of time thinking in.
