[speaking of which][1], there&#8217;s also [The Real London Underground: Experimental Music at the End of the 90s][2], in which kenneth goldsmith makes a map of the london underground (music) of the time. 

His mention of chris cutler makes the article appropiately relevant for the discussion sparked by his recent [filesharing epiphany][3] published in the wire, in which he admitted *&#8220;As a result, just like you, I stopped buying music.&#8221;*, and got responses from [chris cutler][4] and [david keenan][5]. The fact that the 90s article seems to be based on one of the record hunting field trips that he mentions in epyphany no.4 gives a nice context to the discussion.
