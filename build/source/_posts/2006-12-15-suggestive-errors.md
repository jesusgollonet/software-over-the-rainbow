[Beans][1] (the one i know) is a hip hop mc, formerly a member of the great [Antipop Consortium][2].  
![Beans][3]

[(The) Beans][4] are a canadian post rock band, which I didn&#8217;t know before. They&#8217;re good if you&#8217;re into [do make say think][5] and bands like that.

It seems like last.fm is not so sure about that difference, as [they give credit for Tired Snow (a recent record by The Beans) to Beans, the mc][7].

But far from annoying me, it gave me a magic moment yesterday when I was recommended [Miko][8], a song from that record. I spent the whole three minutes waiting to hear how the [abstract avant garde rap][9] of the former would fit with the [canadian instrumental post rock][10] of the latter.

Still thinking&#8230;
