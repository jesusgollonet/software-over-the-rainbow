Back in january I spent some time exploring simple electronic circuits for sound, following the lovely [handmade electronic music][1]. One of the greatest discoveries was [voltage starving][2], which gave a great degree of unpredictability to any circuit.

I recorded some explorations. I find it interesting to imagine what is happening inside the circuit to make the sound vary so wildly, as I was just slowly turning up and down a couple of knobs.
